Wavelets
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gummif/Wavelets.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gummif/Wavelets.jl)

A [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) package for very fast wavelet transforms (1D, 2D, by filtering or lifting).

Rouchly 20x speedup and 50x less memory usage than [this](https://github.com/tomaskrehlik/Wavelets) implementation of `dwt`. Loosely inspired by [this](https://github.com/tomaskrehlik/Wavelets) and [this](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab). See benchmarks and a todo list below.

* 1st generation wavelets using filter banks (periodic and orthogonal). Filters are included for the following types: Haar, Daubechies, Coiflet, Symmlet, Battle-Lemarie, Beylkin, Vaidyanathan.

* 2nd generation wavelets by lifting (periodic and general type including orthogonal and biorthogonal). Included lifting schemes are currently only for Haar and Daubechies (under development).

Usage
---------

A rough idea of the API:

```julia
# set up filter (Periodic, Orthogonal, 4 vanishing moments)
wt = POfilter("Coiflet", 4)
# or do it this way
wt = POfilter("coif4")
# the input object determines the transform type 
# wt now contains instructions for a periodic lifting scheme
wt = GPLS("coif4")
# xt is a 5 level transform of vector x
xt = fwt(x, 5, wt)
# x2 is approx. equal to x
x2 = iwt(xt, 5, wt)

# scaling filters is easy
wt1 = scale(POfilter("haar"), 1/sqrt(2))
# signals can be transformed inplace with a low-level command
# requiring very little memory allocation (especially for L=1)
dwt!(x, L, wt, true)      # inplace by lifting
dwt!(xt, x, L, wt, true)  # write to xt by filtering
```


Benchmarks
---------

Timing of `fwt` (using `db2` filter of length 4) and `fft`. The wavelet transforms are faster and use less memory than `fft` in all cases. `fwt` by lifting is currently an order of magnitude faster than by filtering.

```julia
# 10 iterations
fwt by filtering (N=1048576), 18 levels
elapsed time: 1.262672396 seconds (125866088 bytes allocated, 2.35% gc time)
fwt by lifting (N=1048576), 18 levels
elapsed time: 0.153162937 seconds (104927608 bytes allocated, 13.18% gc time)
fft (N=1048576), (FFTW)
elapsed time: 2.836224168 seconds (587236088 bytes allocated, 4.83% gc time)
```

For 2D transforms by filtering (using `db6` of length 12):
```julia
# 10 iterations
fwt (N=1024 x 1024), 8 levels
elapsed time: 2.422658432 seconds (98389208 bytes allocated, 0.79% gc time)
iwt (N=1024 x 1024), 8 levels
elapsed time: 2.048636659 seconds (95275608 bytes allocated, 0.98% gc time)
fft (N=1024 x 1024), (FFTW)
elapsed time: 2.945895417 seconds (587236728 bytes allocated, 4.69% gc time)
```

By using the low-level function `dwt!` and pre-allocating temporary arrays, significant gains can be made in terms of memory usage (and a little speedup). This is useful when transforming multiple signals.
```julia
# 1000 iterations
dwt! (N=32768), 13 levels
elapsed time: 5.081105993 seconds (701512 bytes allocated)
fwt (N=32768), 13 levels
elapsed time: 5.151621451 seconds (395317512 bytes allocated, 1.62% gc time)
```
